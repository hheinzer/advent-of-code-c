# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles,
all written in C. In 2024 I started using [cdsa](https://github.com/hheinzer/cdsa) for data
structures and algorithms. At some point I will convert the previous years, because these puzzles
are a great way to verify correctness.

Compile and run any of the puzzles with:

    $ make <year>/<day> && ./<year>/<day>
